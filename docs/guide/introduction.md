# Introduction

I have always thought that breadcrumbs should be closely linked to routers. This is why I have created this module, which extends some router classes to define titles (static or dynamic) when defining routes by chaining methods. These titles will then be used to generate breadcrumbs automatically.

You can also create a separate file that will be preloaded at the time of booting your AdonisJS application, to define titles **_only_** for named routes.
